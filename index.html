    <h2>Question - 1 Create one function with zero parameter having a console statement;</h2>

    <h2>Ans-1 
        <script>
        function noParam(){
        document.write("Hello welcome to function....");
    }
    
    noParam();

    <h2>Question-2 Create one function which takes two values as a parameter and print the sum of them as "Sum of 3, 4 is 7"</h2>

    <h2>
        Ans-2
        <script>

            function param(a,b){

                document.write(`"The sum of ${a}, ${b} is : ${a+b}  "`);
            }

            param(3,4);
        </script>

    <h2>
        Question-3 Create one arrow function
    </h2>

    <h2> 
        Ans-3
        <script>

         let arrowFunction = (() => {
            document.write("This is a arrow Function");

        Question-4 
        var x = 21;
        var girl = function () {
            console.log(x);
            var x = 20;
        };
        girl ();
    </h2>

    <h2>

        Ans-4

        <script >

        var x = 21;
        var girl = function () {
            console.log(x);
            var x = 20;
        };
        girl ();

        </script>
         Output is undefined 
         Reason: is the hoisting here we are using the x variable before it's  declaration and initialization or assignment <br>
          so that the variable  is declared into the memory but it's value is undefined into memory.

         <!-- and var is the global scope -->
    </h2>



     <h2>
        Question-5 
        "Print output: 
 var x = 21;
 girl ();
 console.log(x)
 function girl() {
    console.log(x);
    var x = 20;
    };
   "
    </h2>

    <h2>
        Ans-5
        output - undefined 
                  <br>
                  21

  <br> reason : the girl(); is called first and it's normal function in the girl(); function we have our var variable which is used before
  <br> before it's declaration and initialization so we will get the output as undefined due to hoisting
  <br> and after that we printing the x variable which is var so it's value is already initilised into the memory and
  it's global defined so we will get the value as 21
    </h2>


    <h2>
        Question-6
        "Print output

var x = 21;
a();
b();

  function a() {
    
   x = 20;
  console.log(x);
};
 function b() {
    
    x = 40;
   console.log(x);
};"

    </h2>


    <h2> output: is 20 <br> 40 as we are using the values after it's initialization so it will go the 
    global executin context and change its previous value
    </h2>



<h2>Question-7:  Write a function that accepts parameter n and returns factorial of n</h2>

<h2> Ans-7  <br>

    <script>
        function fact(n){

            let fact=1;
            for(i=1; i<=n ; i++) {

              fact = fact*i;  
            }

            // ("The factorial of ", n , " is ");
            return fact;

        }

        document.write("The factorial is : " ,fact(3));
    </script>
</h2>


<h2> Question -1 
    "Guess the Output

function FindSum(a, b){
    return a + b;
}

function DisplayData(data, batch){
    console.log(`i am from ${data} and My batch is EA${batch}`)
}

DisplayData(""PrepBytes"", FindSum(10, 9));"
</h2>

<h2>
    output is <br>
    i am from PrepBytes and My batch is EA19

    <br> here we have used the FindSum(a,b) funtion as argument in the DisplayData("PrepBytes", FindSum(10,9));  <br>
    function so it is getting called. now the DisplayData function code which take the two parameter and we
    have already passed the arguments so data = PrepBytes and batch = FindSum(10,9) function is called and it return the sum of that arguments to the function
</h2>



<h2>
     Question-2
    "Guess the output

    Abc();
    const Abc = function(){
        let value = 20;
        console.log(value);
    }"</h2>
<h2>
    Abc only created and memory is given to the Abc  and we are using Abc before it's initialization so it gives an error
    reference error like  br cannot access 'Abc' before initialization.
</h2>


<h2>Question-3 
    "Guess the output

var a = 10;
(function (){
    console.log(a);
    var a = 20;
})();"
</h2>

<h2>
    output: undefined <br>
    The function is self invokation function and we have used the var a=10; as a global varaible it is in memory <br>

    when we go into the function a is redeclared so it's memory is also created and we are using that a before it's 
    declaration so we will get the output as undefined.
    
</h2>


<h2>

    Question-4
    "Guess the Output
const greet =  function(name){
    return function(m){
    
        console.log(`Hi!! ${name}, ${m}`);
    }
}
  
const greet_message = greet('EA19');
greet_message(""Welcome To PrepBytes"")"
</h2>
 <br>
<h2>

    output : Hi!! EA19, Welcome To PrepBytes  <br> <br>
    Explanation <br>
    here our greet_message is function defination and greet_message having the parameter which goes into the m <br>
    the value it's taking is the Welcome To PrepBytes <br> greet is also one function which taking the one paramter 
    <br> so we have passed the EA19 into the greet("EA19"); and greet() function is retrns one function that we have called and passed the arguments 
    called as greet_message(m);
